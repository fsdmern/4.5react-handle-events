React Events:
=============
React Events are named using camelCase.
While using JSX we pass a function as the event handler, rather than a string.
React Events are cross-browser compatible

//In Java Script
<button onclick="showactiveusers()">Show active users</button>

//In React
<button onClick={showActiveUsers}>Show active users</button>

Passing Arguments to Event Handlers:
====================================
<button onClick={(e) => this.deleteRow(id, e)}>Delete Row</button>
<button onClick={this.deleteRow.bind(this,id)}>Delete Row</button>

Conditional Rendering:
======================

Element Variables:
==================
This can help us conditionally render a part of component while rest of the output doesnt change
